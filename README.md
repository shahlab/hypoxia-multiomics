This repo contains the code and associated files for "Multiomics Analysis of Metabolic Reprogramming by the Hypoxia Response Pathway", currently found on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).

### Repo organization
The repo is organized into folders with self-descriptive names. For example, code contains the code used to process the data, perform analysis, and make figures. Likewise, `data` contains the data files used during the analysis. Note that some data files are missing because they are too large to place here and must be generated by running the code.

### Running the code
Prior to running the code, download the following files and place them in the `data` folder.
